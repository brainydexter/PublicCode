things to do

- render in entire screen
- special effects:
 - score Multiplier
 - bad word
- audio
- controller as singleton
- game state machine
- layout & center game tiles
- how can i render an object in my own render call and not rely on scene, e.g. blocks in blockMgr
- check click against rectangle and not centre point
- when selected block = falling block, make it fall down all the way
- minify js

Bugs:
- handle resize and modify layout


Solved Bugs
- make the block inactive only when it cannot fall down anymore
 - mark activeBlock = null in move() only for down direction and when it cannot move more
- when the block is at extreme right or left, attempt to move further right or left causes out of boundary access in array in boardMgr::move()
- recycling used blocks
 - use circular queues : won't work since I'm not moving the blocks in queue, so the blocks can be out of order
 - use greedy approach of finding the first non visible block and return that for dequeue
- fix loading dictionary

DONE
- blocks should fall slowly
- how to render text on top of tile 
 - Render to texture and place it on top of cube
 - Render to html div and update the position of div as block moves
- plug in letterGenerator
 - using boggle algorithm
- mouse selects letters
 - lots of corner cases covered
- spell check
 - client side dictionary
- collision detection when letters are removed
 - BoardMgr::processWord
- Score
 - Display with each letter
 - Display total score: added word score and bonus score for various word lengths
